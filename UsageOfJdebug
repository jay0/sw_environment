Users can utilize Jdebug to assist in finding abnormal threads of their computing applications on Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. The steps are:
1. Task submissions. In the front-end machine, submit a computing application executing on the computing nodes with “bsub -I -n <process_number> <program_name> [<args>]” command and other desired configurations. After the task is successfully submitted, one can get the job id “jobid” of the task.
2. The application of Jdebug. When the program is abnormal or the users are anxious about whether the program is executed normally, they can run Jdebug in the front-end machine to analyze the program and find the abnormal threads.To use the program counter invariant based screening algorithm of detecting hanging threads, one can run “Jdebug jobid” command; to use the function invariant based screening algorithm, one can run “Jdebug -f jobid” command. And one can access detailed data obtained by the tool in the “.Jdebug_<jobid>_<time>.res” file on current directory for further analysis.
